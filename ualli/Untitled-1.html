        <h1>What is Parkinson's Disease?</h1>
        <p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also causes stiffness or slowing of movement.</p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tremor (shaking), usually in the hands or fingers</li>
            <li>Slowed movement (bradykinesia)</li>
            <li>Muscle stiffness</li>
            <li>Impaired posture and balance</li>
            <li>Changes in speech and writing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Parkinson’s disease occurs when nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine become impaired or die. The exact cause is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors may play a role.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>While there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, medications can help manage symptoms. In some cases, surgical options may be considered.</p>
